# WatchParty
Simultaneously watch Youtube videos with others! Chat while you watch! Archive the parties to relive the memories!

After logging in, You are taken to your Dashboard where you can see the current top rooms. There is a list of reminders for the upcoming parties you are attending.

You can use the SEARCH bar to search for public rooms, users or videos. Clicking on a room will bring you to that room. You can follow users to have their parties prioritized on your page. If somebody's being less than excellent, you can block them. They will no longer show up in searches or in chats, and you won't show up in theirs.

CREATE a party! Set it to public to allow anyone to join, or set it to private and allow only those with an invitation to attend. Add as many videos as you'd like to the party, or choose a saved playlist. You can choose to save the videos as a new playlist. You can choose to have the party archived for later.

WATCH a party! As a creator or admin, you will have the ability to start or pause the video. If you're a 'normie', just sit back and enjoy the show. Anyone can comment in the chat as the party is going on.

The also is a VOICE CONTROL option, for those with difficulty navigating with a mouse and keyboard. After turning the microphone on, navigate to other pages by saying "Go to --" or "take me --". You can also search for keywords by saying "search for --" and then "send". Once on the search results page, you can open a party by saying "open --" or "start the party called *". You can also follow, unfollow or block users with commands like "follow --"
